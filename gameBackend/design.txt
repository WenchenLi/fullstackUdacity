my idea is implement an ai learn from the user while user playing against ai,

game:
cron tasks:
task queue: push (app engine works on the url specified jobs)
            pull ( external workers like other api url works on the job get result within a lease time)

memcache: (ndb automatically work this or I can specify what need to be cached)
