I'll implement concentration.
my idea is each game board is represented by a x by y matrix that the user can
specify.
for the content: each entry in the matrix is a combination of english chars and
numbers with maximum length of given value z

The objective of the user is to flip all the entry in the matrix with minimum
number of attempts( more punishment can be implemented later like if flip but get
error more times at the same entry, gets more punishment)

my extra idea for the extra is implement an ai try to build a memory mechanism
by itself.

game:
cron tasks:
task queue: push (app engine works on the url specified jobs)
            pull ( external workers like other api url works on the job get result within a lease time)

memcache: (ndb automatically work this or I can specify what need to be cached)
