The game implemented is concentration.
my idea is each game board is represented by an array that the user can
specify.
for the content: each element in the array is a combination of english chars and
numbers with maximum length of 10

The objective of the user is to flip all the entry in the array with minimum
number of attempts. Currently the maximum attempts is 2 times of the length of
the pairs in the array, so length of the array.

(UNDER development)
my extra idea for the extra is implement an AI try to build a memory mechanism
by itself to play to game. And then play against human.

task queue push: this is used to keep records of the active games
memcache: this is used to fast retrieve leaderboard information like user ranking
and user score.


game:
cron tasks: notify user only their game hasn't finished
task queue: push (app engine works on the url specified jobs)
            pull ( external workers like other api url works on the job get result within a lease time)

memcache: (ndb automatically work this or I can specify what need to be cached)
